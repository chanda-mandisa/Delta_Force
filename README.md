# Delta Force Cybersecurity

**Delta Force Cybersecurity** is an open-source collective dedicated to investigating and exposing digital exploitation, harassment, and abuse. Our mission is to empower individuals—especially those often silenced or targeted—by using open-source intelligence (OSINT), ethical cybersecurity practices, and digital forensics to build evidence-based cases, advocate for justice, and restore safety.

## Objectives

- Investigate cases of online abuse (e.g., revenge porn, harassment, content suppression, stalking, and digital exploitation).
- Provide public documentation and transparency where appropriate, while respecting victim confidentiality.
- Develop open-source tools and frameworks to support investigations and evidence gathering.
- Collaborate with ethical hackers, researchers, and digital rights advocates to address systemic issues in cybersecurity and platform governance.

## Principles

- **Transparency**: All findings and methods are documented openly (where legal and ethical).
- **Ethics-First**: We prioritize privacy, consent, and the safety of survivors.
- **Decentralized Justice**: We seek to create a framework of accountability that doesn't rely solely on flawed or biased institutions.
- **Empowerment through Knowledge**: We equip others with tools and knowledge to protect themselves and challenge injustice.

## Structure

This repository serves as the central hub for the Delta Force Cybersecurity collective. Individual investigations are housed in sub-repositories under this umbrella. Each investigation includes documentation, visual evidence (redacted if necessary), and technical notes.
