# Evidence

This folder contains collected digital artifacts used to support the Twitch Suppression Investigation. All files have been reviewed for relevance and are either unmodified or minimally redacted for safety and privacy.


## Structure

- `/screenshots/`  
  Still images capturing:
  - Stream Manager dashboard metrics
  - Anomalies in viewer counts, chat behavior, or follower activity
  - Visible inconsistencies in Twitch's UI or analytics

- `/recordings/`  
  Screen recordings of:
  - Suppressed or zero-viewer streams in progress
  - Dashboard usage and backend behavior
  - Live monitoring of metrics and mod actions


## Guidelines

- All timestamps and filenames should be as specific and consistent as possible (e.g., `2025-03-28_dashboard_zero_viewers.png`).
- When applicable, blur or redact personal identifying information before uploading.
- Metadata (e.g., capture device, software, time) is preserved where relevant and anonymized where necessary.
