# Twitch Suppression Investigation

This repository documents an ongoing investigation into potential algorithmic and/or manual suppression, shadowbanning, and discriminatory moderation practices on Twitch.

## Purpose

The goal of this investigation is to:

- Collect and archive firsthand evidence of content suppression on Twitch.
- Document irregularities in stream visibility, follower count behavior, and viewership metrics.
- Compare behavior across platforms and accounts to detect patterns or inconsistencies.
- Present findings in a clear, public format to promote accountability and transparency.

## Contents

- `/evidence/screenshots/`: Images showing view count anomalies, account status, or dashboard metrics.
- `/evidence/recordings/`: Screen recordings of suppressed streams, chat logs, or mod actions.

## Methodology

- All evidence was collected directly from the Twitch Stream Manager and public-facing profile pages.
- Comparison was made against baseline metrics from similar accounts to identify anomalies.

## Status
